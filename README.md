# Style Sheet

## Abbreviations
Avoid abbreviations, which can confuse users. 

#### Example
~~Enum~~ Enumeration set names and set members are case sensitive.

## Acronyms 
The first time you use an acronym, give the complete meaning. Thereafter, the letters suffice.

#### Example
Creates a new certificate signing request (CSR). A successfully (201) response provides the CSR in a PEM format.

## Active voice
In general, use active over passive voice. The active voice tells the user who is performing the action. Sentences written in active voice increase clarity. 

#### Example
~~ The definition of X can be found at the relative URL of Y. ~~ Find the definition of X at the relative URL of Y.

#### Exceptions
There are a few situations in which the passive voice is acceptable:
- When the subject is unknown
- When the action, not the doer, is the focus of the sentence
- Where the sentence becomes less clear.

## Anthropomorphism
Anthropomorphism means to give human attributes to an inanimate object. Avoid attributing human characteristics to devices and software.

#### Example
The operation ~~tells you~~ returns the response.

## Concision
Be concise, but do not truncate sentences. 

## Contractions
Avoid contractions like "don’t" and "can’t". Use "do not" and "cannot". 

## Latin terms
Avoid Latin terms, which can cause ambiguity for users. 

#### Example
**e.g.** for example
**i.e.** avoid (do not restate sentences, rewrite)
**etc.** avoid (list out all elements if relevant)
**via** through/with

## Pronouns
Use second person (“you”) to create user-centric documentation. Avoid other pronouns, or constructions like “the user” and “the consumer”.

## References
As a general rule, use “see” when referencing a section within the document and use “refer” when referencing an external document.

#### Example
See Enumerations.
Refer to the Microsoft Style Guide.

## Tense
Write in the present tense (avoid “will”). The present tense brings clarity and immediacy to a process or procedure. In general, avoid writing in the future tense (there are some legitimate circumstances to use the future tense, for example, when referring to a future release).

Use the imperative, or command mood (avoid “should”). 

#### Example
The schema ~~will show you~~ shows which members of the enumeration (if any) are editable.
~~You should e~~Enter your password.
